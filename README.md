PK has landed on a new planet called Earth and lost the communication device to his spaceship. All he
does all day is LOOK UP. Look for a place he knew as home. A place that was as much a reflection of him
as he was of the place.Help PK find a place that would make him miss his planet less. A place that
appeals to his eccentric taste of food, culture and architecture.
